This is the perl5 DBZ_File distribution, written by Wayne Davison.
It probably only works with perl version 5.003 and later.

This package allows a perl program to read and write a DBZ database,
such as the news history file.  It does support the creation of a new
database if the .pag and .lib files are missing -- just call the tie
function with a create flag and a mode (see the documentation).

The default Makefile.PL assumes that you've got dbz.h and libdbz.a
installed on your system.  If you don't, add any needed -I and -L
directives, or reference the object files directly, as required.

You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Please feel free to send any bug reports, suggestions, etc., to:
<wayne@clari.net>.

Enjoy!
